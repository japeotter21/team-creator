# Team Creator
React/Astro/Tailwind
- I created this to solve a very specific problem, which is why this is limited to two separate lists, only creates teams of two, and has no data persistence.
- Instead of pairing random indexes between the two lists, I thought it would create better randomness and execute faster if I shuffled the lists, then paired the indexes in order
- I wanted to try using Astro instead of Nextjs but this ended up being a poor use case for Astro

Separate players into 2 lists by an attribute (left-handed/right-handed, boy/girl, ATL/GVL, etc.) then create randomized teams of 2, pulling from both lists as much as possible.
